# Mission-to-Mars

Robin wants to add more polish to her web app. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She wants to  include all four of the hemisphere images. With the help of BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we are able to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database( mission-to-mars-app), use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images on the ipad or phone.
